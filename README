PURPOSE OF SOFTWARE: The purpose of this software is to perform matrix arithmetic. Specifically, it solves the mathematical formula:
D = A + (3 × B) × C^t, where C^t is the transpose of matrix C.
FILES:
  - matrixC.c: A C implementation that transposes matrix C, multiplies matrix B by 3, and then adds the product to matrix A.
  - matrixCPP.cpp: A C++ implementation that performs the same operations as the C version.
BUILD INSTRUCTIONS: 
- Use a C/C++ Compiler such as g++
- Compile Programs: 
      matrixC.c: g++ -Wall matrixC.c -o matrixC
      matrixCPP.cpp: g++ -Wall matrixCPP.cpp -o matrixCPP
- Run Executables:
      ./matrixC
      ./matrixCPP
TESTING METHODOLOGY: 
      - The program is tested using hardcoded arrays for matrices A, B, and C.
      - Outputs were compared tocalculated expected results.
      - Program was tested on a Linux.

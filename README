PURPOSE OF SOFTWARE: The purpose of this software is to perform matrix arithmetic. For example, it solves the mathematical formula:
D = A + (3 × B) × C^t, where C^t is the transpose of matrix C.
FILES:
  - matrixC.c: A C implementation that transposes matrix ( C ), multiplies matrix ( B ) by 3, and then adds the product to matrix ( A ).
  - matrixCPP.cpp: A C++ implementation that performs the same operations as the C version.
BUILD INSTRUCTIONS: 
- Use a C/C++ Compiler such as g++
- Compile Programs: 
      matrixC.c: gcc -std=c99 matrixC.c -o matrixC
      matrixCPP.cpp: gcc -x c++ -o matrixCPP.cpp -lstdc++
- Run Executables:
      ./matrixC
      ./matrixCPP
TESTING METHODOLOGY: 
      - For the C++ implementation, matrix objects were initialized in main.
      - For the C implementation, arrays were created in main and tested through function calls.
      - Outputs were compared to calculated expected results.
      - The program was tested on Linux.
